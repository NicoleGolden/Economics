                        So why milk consumption? According to USDA, there has been a consistent decline in dairy milk consumption. In 1970, the daily per capita consumption of dairy milk was about 1 cup. By 2019, the daily per capita consumption reduced to half. Plant-based milk partly contributes to the decline, despite its price premium. People may consume plant-based milk as a nutrient substitute, and it's considered more environmentally friendly and better for animal welfare. During COVID-19, plant-based milk became more trendy for reasons such as health or change of lifestyle. This makes the study of consumption for both types of milk important.

                        And this brings me to my research question: How does migration to another state affect dairy & plant-based milk consumption? Specifically, my research uncovers the expenditure patterns for both types of milk, and learns how the new local environment affects HH’s expenditures. This research fills in the current research gaps and quantifies these questions. It also has dietary-related policy implications, especially the policy for the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, known as WIC.

                        Here's a comparison of dairy and plant-based milk. In terms of sales growth in 2019, dairy milk experienced only a 0.1% increase, whereas it's 5% for plant-based milk. Traditional dairy milk contains lactose. It can be made lactose-free of course. But plant-based milk is inherently lactose-free. Dairy milk is a type of conventional beverage because it's been around since the 19th century, whereas plant-based milk is a type of functional beverage. It's designed not only to satisfy our desire for a milk-like taste but also our nutritional needs. Lastly, plant-based milk has many other advantages in this modern world: such as lower environmental impact, as you can see from the figures here. Its production doesn't involve animals; it satisfies a flexitarian lifestyle, so if you're vegan or allergic to dairy milk, plant-based milk is a more suitable alternative. During COVID-19, many people also started to consume plant-based milk instead of just dairy milk.

                        To answer the questions I raised earlier, I use Nielsen consumer panel data. The data covers weekly milk purchases from 200 thousand HHs in 49 states. It has 16 years of data from 2004 to 2019. For dairy milk, it includes the most common types such as whole milk, reduced-fat milk, skim milk, etc. Plant-based milk may be almond milk, soy milk, and oat milk. The outcome variable is the log quarterly milk expenditures per person. The HH characteristics include important features such as age, educ, income, etc. The treatment variable is whether the HH moved to another state, and I only include those who moved once. The final data is aggregated at a quarterly level for each HH, so I have identified about 5 thousand movers & 185 thousand non-movers.

                        To validate my research, I did several data pre-checks. First, I want to make sure the movers and non-movers are comparable. The summary statistics show that, in general, there are some differences, but they are not too far from each other. For example, the movers are more likely to be white and older, have higher income and education; meanwhile, non-movers have a bit larger family size, a slightly higher employment rate, and a larger ratio of children who are under 18 years old. Second, I want to make sure that HHs move randomly, not for some other systematic reasons. I use a standard logit model to check for that. The results show that HHs do move randomly since most coefficients are not significant.

                        Finally, I want to make sure that, after the move, there's indeed an increase or a decrease in milk consumption using an event study. The figures here show that: for both types of milk, the pre-move coefficients are close to zero. After the move, there is a clear increase trend for dairy milk and a decrease trend for plant-based milk. Next, we'll turn to the difference-in-differences model, or we call it DiD model, to quantify the exact expenditure changes.

                        This DiD model looks similar to the standard DiD model earlier but with an added term. The \( \Delta_{it} \) term here is called "size of move", which is the difference between average milk expenditures in the mover's new state vs old state.
                        By interacting "size of move" with treatment variable, we get \( \beta \), our interest. It measures how much the milk expenditures converge toward the new states’ average.

                        Why should we care about financial health? According to Financial Health Network, an NGO that has been studying the financial health of Americans for the past decade, about 67% of Americans are not financially healthy. Let me explain. Financial Health Network used the University of Southern California survey data of more than 6 thousand respondents, and found that, on average, 37% of individuals spend more than their income or can't pay bills on time, 47% don't have sufficient liquid savings or long-term savings, 38% have unmanageable debt or non-prime credit, and 42% don't have appropriate insurance or don't plan ahead financially. We can see that poor financial health in America is still prevalent.

                        In my study, I'd like to focus on the group who have non-prime credits. The non-prime consumers tend to take out payday loans. According to CFPB, there are 12 million payday loan users per year. People are attracted to borrow payday loans because they are typically small-dollar, short-term, and unsecured. However, payday loans are very costly. Typically the APRs are between 300 to 500%. As of 2020, 22 states either banned or effectively banned payday loans, because they see payday loans as predatory loans. Among the rest of the states where payday loans are still legal, 15 states passed so-called extended payment plans to protect payday loan borrowers.

                        In my research, I'd like to answer this question: Do extended payment plans improve financial health? Wang and Burke (2022) did a similar research. They studied the effects of information disclosure in Texas starting in 2012. The disclosure compares the cost of payday loans vs other credit products, and presents their likelihood of renewal in simple terms. They found that the disclosures have led to a significant and persistent decline in payday loan volume. In my study, the extended payment plan is a much broader payday loan policy since they typically require more than information disclosure, and it's applied to multiple states instead of just one state.

                        Let me introduce a bit more about payday loan. It's legal in 29 states as of 2020. It's a small-dollar loan with a typical loan amount of $500. It's unsecured because it doesn't require any collateral, and it doesn't require a formal credit check. Consumers repay on their next payday. Compared with only 12~30% of APR for credit cards, the payday loan has a much higher APR, typically between 300~500%. Based on advertisements I scrapped from the top 10 payday loan lender's websites, the payday loan is typically featured as being "quick cash, fast, easy, emergency bills." If a user opts in a rollover, which means they choose to pay back on the next payday instead of this one, the charges may double. This feature keeps some consumers in "debt traps."

                        To protect consumers, some states have passed extended payment plans. These plans have the following features:<br> 
	                    Users can choose to repay in 3~4 installments. This is the most salient feature of the plans. And they can repay with zero additional charges. There is a minimum repayment term typically between 60~90 days. The plans may be limited to use once a year. Consumers may only be eligible if they reach a threshold of rollovers. The lenders may be required to disclose the availability of the extended payment plans.

                        The main data I use for the study is Clarity payday loan data. Clarity is the largest payday loan data in the market, which covers 60 million or 70% of non-prime consumers in the US. It has 6 years of data from 2015 to 2020. It covers imporant borrower's characteristics, such as age, income, and pay frequency, which helps us to improve our estimates. In my study, I have constructed 4 financial health related indicators: amount past due, original charge-off, delinquency rate, charge-off or debt-in-collections rate. The final data is aggregated at a quarterly level for each state. In the end, we have 5 treated states and 14 control states.

That's where I identify the exact dates when extended payment plans took effect. Then I can construct treatment variables with these dates. The table here lists the five treated states. The 2 important columns are "state treated" and "quarter being treated". We can see that some states are treated earlier, some later.

                        As usual, we need to do some data pre-checks. First, I want to make sure the borrowers from the treated & control states are comparable. Here are the results from my summary statistics. In general, there may be a bit differences between the two groups, but the differences are small. I also did an event study like in Chapter 1. The results show that there are various degrees of decrease in each outcome variable after the treatment went into effect.

                        To identify the treatment effects of the extended payment plans, I use a synthetic DiD model, or I call it SDID here. At first glance, it looks very similar to DiD model but with two extra terms at the end.<br> 
                        Let me quickly go through some key notations in this equation: <br>
	                    \( Y_{it} \) is the financial health variable in state i, quarter t<br>
	                    \( \mu \) is the intercept<br>
	                    \( \alpha_{i} \) and \(\beta_{t} \) are the state and quarter  FE <br>
	                    \( \tau \) is our interest, the average treatment effect on the treated, or ATT <br>
	                    \( D_{it} \) is the treatment variable<br>
	                    \( w_{i} \) and \( \lambda_{t} \) are unit and time weights, which I will introduce more later.<br>
                        The capital N is total units or states, so here \( N = 19 \) since we have 14 control states and 5 treated states. <br>
 	                    And capital T is total time or quarters, so here \( T = 24 \) since in 6 years we have 24 quarters.<br>

                        So what are unit and time weights exactly? What do they do?<br>   
                        Simply put: Unit weights match the pre-treatment trends between treated & control units. Another way to show how the unit weights work mathematically is the equation in the notes. Basically, the unit weights minimize the difference between the weighted average of the pre-treated outcome of control units and the pre-treated outcome of treated units.<br> 
                        This is similar to what synthetic control does, except that we will have a parallel trend because we included an intercept term \( w_{0} \) here.<br>

                        Because synthetic DID requires a clear definition of the pre-treatment period and control units, we have to run the SDID model for each treated state, so we get 5 ATTs. Then we get the final ATT by re-weighting each ATT by the ratio of a state's treated periods vs total treated periods. For example, the total treated periods for the 5 states is 65, so that's the denominator. Deleware was treated for 8 quarters, so we need to reweight the ATT of Deleware by \( \frac{8}{65} \). And we do the same for Florida, Louisiana, Nevada, and Utah. The final ATT will be the sum.

                        Here's a demonstration of a synthetic DiD plot for the outcome "amount past due". The gray line is for synthetic control, and the red line is for the treated state. Take Nevada as an example: it was treated before quarter 11, and we can see a parallel trend pre-treatment. After the treatment, Nevada appears to have a reduction of the amount past due on average compared to its counterpart. Similar results are shown in the rest of the four treated states.

                        Here are the results for our financial health indicators. Column (1) shows results from the DiD model, which is our base model, and Column (2) shows results from the SDID model. The results are similar, so I'll just focus on the SDID results. On average, we can see there is a reduction in each indicator and they are significant. For example, after passing the law, there is about a $25 reduction in the amount past due and there's a 3% reduction in delinquency rate.

                        Of course, we'll need to do a robustness check as usual. Similar to the previous robustness check, first, I remove the 5 treated states from the data. Then I randomly select 5 states as fake "treated" states. Then re-run the same SDID model. This table shows the results. We can see that the coefficients are small and non-significant. We can conclude that the treatment effects are indeed causal.

                        We have learned that: Payday loan borrowers are prone to "debt traps" because of their high APRs and rollovers. I use the best existing coverage of payday loan data to uncover the effect of extended payment plans on financial health. There's clear evidence that these plans indeed have positive treatment effects on financial health. The policy implication is that, among those states where payday loans are legal, they may also implement similar plans to protect consumers.<br> 
                        One limitation of the study is that there are only 5 treated states in the sample data. In the future, we can conduct a more comprehensive study if there's more data coverage, and we can include all 15 treated states.<br>
                        One interesting thing I observed from this study is that, in Clarity data, we can  observe both low & high income earners who take out payday loans. And both income groups may experience negative income volatility. This brings me to the final chapter, which is an extension to Chapter 2.

                        The motivation behind this topic is that, income volatility is still prevalent in the US. Income volatility has risen since the 1970s, and it has affected about half the population in 2010. Notably, 37% of US HHs can't come up with a $400 cash or its equivalent to cover emergency bills. A recent FDIC survey shows that 6 million HHs are "unbanked" and 19 million of HHs are "underbanked".<br><br>
                        <span style="color:red;">Note:</span> using percentage: 5% of HHs are "unbanked" and 14% of them are "underbanked". The "underbanked" are: HH in the past 12 months used some credit products that are commonly used unbanked consumers, such as payday loan, pawn shop, auto title loans.

                        You may wonder: why not they just use traditional banks such as credit cards to borrow money as the charges are much lower? Well, we just saw that a 6 million US population is "unbanked", which means they don't have a bank account, so they don't have access to traditional credit. For those who do have bank accounts, they may fear jeopardizing their credit scores by borrowing from banks. So they resort to payday loans, which don't require checking their credit scores. Given how "predatory" the payday loan is, some states passed the extended payment plans to protect the consumers.

                        I'll also skip the Clarity data and the extended payment plans legal status. What I'd like to add here is the definition of income volatility. There are many ways to quantify income volatility. In my research, I decided to use the income coefficient of variation, or I just call it income CV. We get income CV by dividing the standard deviation of income by the mean of income and multiplying by 100%. So income CV will always be positive, It indicates the magnitude of the changes in income and covers the changes of income in both directions, positive or negative. And the larger the values are, the more volatile the income is. The final data is aggregated at a yearly level for each borrower. So there will be 6 separate sample data, for 2015, 2016, 2017, etc. In 2015, there were about 1500 borrowers in treated states & 4 thousand borrowers in control states. For the rest of the years, the borrowers may increase or decrease a bit.<br><br>
                        <span style="color:red;">Note:</span> Income CV is used in various papers, such as Hannagan and Morduch (2015), which uses the US Financial Diaries data to study income volatility.

                        As usual, I also do data-prechecks to make sure the borrowers from control and treated states are comparable. In general, these two groups are similar. For the treated group, the borrowers' financial health variables may have a bit higher values; they may reside a bit longer at current place, and more are likely to be paid monthly. For the control group, the borrowers are more likely to be paid weekly.

                        To estimate conditional average treatment effect or CATE, I'll need to estimate ATE first. The model I'll be using is double machine learning, or I call it DML.                            
                        The first equation is our main equation: which estimates the treatment effect, \( \tau \), which is the difference between mean treated outcomes and control outcomes, shown in equation 3. The second equation keeps track of the dependence of the treatment variable D on controls X.  This equation is not our main interest, but it is important for removing regularization bias. The confounding factors X affect the policy variable D through function \( m_{0}(X) \) and the outcome variable through function \( g_{0}(X) \). <br>
                        So the functions \( g_{0}(\cdot) \) and \( m_{0}(\cdot) \) are some non-linear machine learning model, which I'll introduce more later. Y is the financial health variable, D is treatment variable, X is a set of borrowers' features such as age, housing status. And \( \tau \) is the ATE we want to identify.

                        The double machine learning works very similarly to the FWL theorem. It works in 2 steps: first, run 2 separate regressions using some non-linear machine learning models, regress outcome y on features X, get residualized y; and regress treatment D on features X, get residualized D. Second, regress residualized y on residualized D to get treatment effect \( \tau \).<br> 
                        In step 1, we don't really care much about the coefficients on X. We just want to take advantage of the machine learning model's prediction power to get good predictions of y and D.  
                        In residualized y and D: all variance due to X is explained way.
                        That's how in step 2, we can get the causal effect \( \tau \).<br>
                        The machine learning I'll use is random forest. To avoid overfitting, we'll use 5-fold cross-validation, which is a pretty common setting. I use random forest because of its efficiency and great prediction performance. The final ATE is the average of the 5-fold estimates.

                        This table shows results for variable "amount past due". I'll just use this variable as an example. All results shown here are negative and significant except for 2015. That's probably because most states haven't passed the plans yet. There's no clear pattern of increasing or decreasing. Of course, for 2020 results, we need to take special considerations since most of the year was in COVID-19 shocks.<br>
                        For example: from 2019-2020, the number of borrowers reduced by 44%. The reasons can be the following:<br> 
                        First, fewer payday loans were approved due to the pandemic when people were losing jobs and experiencing declined income.<br>
                        Second, both federal and local governments implemented various stimulus and relief measures that reduced the need for payday loans.<br>
                        On top of that, the consumers simply spent less during the pandemic.<br>
                        For these reasons, I include the 2020 result just for reference. We can see the effect is quite large here. But we can't really take that as it is due to the COVID-19 shocks.

                        Here are some visualizations for CATE for the variable "amount past due". The overall trend for each year appears to be U-shaped: borrowers at the first quartile gradually receive more and more treatment effect; people who are between the first quartile and median income volatility benefit the most from the plans; people between median and third quartile receive less and less treatment effect until the effect disappears; after the third quartile, people do not seem to receive any treatment effect at all.<br> 
                        So overall, people whose income volatility is below third quartile do receive a reduction in their amount past due because of extended payment plans.

                        I'll just add some comments on top of the results I just presented: The income CV used in this chapter is invariant to scales or absolute changes in income. So it won't show income dynamics over time, for example, whether the income volatility moves toward a positive or negative direction. Future work could introduce other types of income volatility measurements that can show how frequent the income changes are and the directions of the changes. And maybe they can lead to some other interesting findings.
