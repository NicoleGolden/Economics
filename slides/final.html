                        So why milk consumption? According to USDA, there's a consistent decline in dairy milk consumption since the 1970s. For example, in 1970, the daily per capita consumption in dairy milk is about 1 cup. By 2019, the daily per capita consumption reduced to half. Plant-based milk partly contributes to the decline, despite its price premium. People may consume plant-based milk as a nutrient substitute, and it's considered as more environmentally friendly and better for animal welfare. During covid-19, there was an increasing trend in consuming plant-based milk for reasons such as health or change of lifestyle. This makes the study of consumption for both types of milk important.

                        And brings to my research question: How does migration to another state affect dairy & plant-based milk consumption? Specifically, my research uncovers the expenditure patterns for both types of milk, and learns how the new local environment affects HH’s expenditures. This research fills in the current research gaps and quantifies these questions. It also has dietary related policy implications, especially to the policy for Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, or known as WIC.

                        Here's a comparison of dairy and plant-based milk. In terms of sales growth, dairy milk expericed only 0.1% increase in 2019, whearas it's 5% for plant-based milk. Traditional dairy milk contains lactose. It can be made lactose-free of course. But plant-based milk is inherently lactose-free. Dairy milk is a type of conventional beverage because it's been around since the 19th century. Whearas plant-based milk is a type of functional beverage. It's designed not only to satisfy our desire for milk-like taste but also nutritional needs. Lastly, plant-based milk has many other advantages in this modern world: such as lower environmental impact, as you can see the figures here; its production doesn't involve animals; it satisfies flexitarian lifestyle, so if you're vegan or allergic to dairy milk, plant-based milk is a more suitable alternative. During covid-19, many people also started to consume plant-based milk instead of just dairy milk.

                        To answer the questions I raised earlier, I use Nielsen consumer panel data. The data covers weekly milk purchases from 200 thousand HHs in 49 states, excluding Alaska & Hawaii. It has 16 years of data from 2004 to 2019. For dairy milk, it include most common types such as whole milk, 2%, 1%, skim milk, etc. Plant milk includes these common types such as almond milk and soy milk. The outcome variable is log quarterly milk expenditures per person. The HH characteristics include important features such as age, educ, income, etc. The treatment variable is identified by whether the HH moved to another state, and I only include those who moved once. Those who moved more than once are excluded. The final data is aggregated at quarterly level for each HH, so I have identified about 5 thousand movers & 185 thousand non-movers (those are HHs who have never moved throughout the sample data).

                        To validate my research, I did several data pre-checks. First, I want to make sure the movers and non-movers are comparable. The summary statistics shows that, in general, there are some differences, but they are not too far from each other. For example, the movers are more likely to be white, have higher income, be older, and have higher education; meanwhile, non-movers have a bit larger family size, a slightly higher employment rate, and a larger ratio of children who are under 18 years old. Their mean marriage rate is identical in the sample. Second, I want to make sure HHs moved at random not for other systematic reasons. I use a standard logit model to vadilate that. The model's results lend evidence that HHs do move randomly (since most coefficients are not significant).

                        Finally, I want to make sure that, after the move, there's indeed an increase or a decrease in the milk consumption after the move using event study. The black dots are estimated coefficients, and the shaded area is 95% confidence interval. For both types of milk, the pre-move coefficients are close to zero. After the move, there is a clear increase trend for dairy milk and decrease trend for plant milk (+0.8% for dairy, -0.1%).The plots clearly suggests that: Prior to the move, there's little evidence of divergence in expenditures for both types of milk. Post move, HHs increase their dairy milk expenditures and decrease plant milk expenditures. Next, we'll turn to  DiD model to quantify the exact expenditure changes.

                        This DiD model looks similar to the standar DiD model earlier but with an added \( \Delta_{it} \) term. It's called "size of move", which is the difference between average milk expenditures in mover's destination state vs origin state.
                        By interacting "size of move" with treatment "post_move", we get \( \beta \), our interest. It measures how much milk expenditures converge towards destination states’ average. <br>

                        (Note: "size of move" is calculated non-movers data only. To compute state-level average outcomes: first average across HHs in each quarter and in each state using sample weights (and info on number of adults), then take average across time periods. You can simply think of this as expenditure of self regress on expenditure difference of others (who are in your destination or origin states)) <br>
                        (Note: "beta" measures the fraction of difference between destination and origin that has been covered. This way, the size of jump after move measures share of average difference between areas that is attributable to current environment.)

                        Just to recap: 1. For dairy milk, after HHs move to another state, their expenditures increased by 1.2%, and about 53% of the changes can be explained by the new local environment; 2. For plant milk, after HHs move to another state, their expenditures decreased by 1.5%, and about 17% of the changes can be explained by the new local environment.
                        One data limitation I want to mention is that, Nielsen only covers some major markets. Since plant milk is not broadly avaialble in smaller cities, the milk purchses recorded in Nielsen may not be representative enough.

                        Why should we care about financial health? According to Financial Health Network, an NGO that has been studying financial health of Americans for the past dacade, an estimated 67% of Americans are not financially healthy. Let me explain. Financial Health Network used the 2020 survey data of 6,430 respondents conducted by University of Southern California, and found that, on average, 37% of individuals spend more than their income or can't pay bills on time, 47% of them don't have sufficient liquid savings or long-term savings, 38% have unmanageable debt or non-prime credit, and 42% don't have appropriate insurance or don't plan ahead financially. We can see that poor financial health is still prevelant in America.

                        In my study, I'd like to focus on the group who have non-prime credits. The non-prime consumers tend to take out payday loans. According to CFPB, there are 12 million payday loan users per year. People are attracted to borrow payday loans because they are typically small-dollar, short-term, and unsecured. However, payday loans are very costly. Typically the APRs are between 300% to 500%. As of 2020, 22 states either banned or effectively banned payday loan, because they see payday loan as predatory loans. Among the rest of states where payday loan is still legal, 15 states passed so called extended payment plans to protect payday loan borrowers.

                        In my reserach, I'd like to answer this question: Do extended payment plans improve financial health? A similar research is done by Wang and Burke (2022). They study the effects of information disclosure in Texas starting 2012 for payday loan consumers. The disclosure compares the cost of payday loans vs other credit products, and presents their likelihood of renewal in simple terms. They found that the disclosures have led to a significant and persistent decline in payday loan volume. In my study, the extended payment plan is a much broader payday loan policy (since they typically require more than information disclousre) and it's applied to multiple states (instead of just Texas).

                        Let me introduce payday loan a bit more here. It's a small-dollar loan with a typical loan amount of $500. It's legal in 29 states as of 2020. It's unsecured because it doesn't require any collateral and it doesn't require formal credit check. Consumers repay in their next payday. Compared with only 12~30% of APR, the payday loan has a much higher APR, typically between 300~500%. Based on advertisements I scrapped from the top 10 payday loan lender's websites, the payday loan is typically featured as being "quick cash, fast, easy, for emergency bill." If the user opts in rollover, which means they choose to pay back in the next payday instead of this one, the charges will double. The rollover feature of the payday loan keeps some consumers in "debt traps."

                        * To protect consumers, some states have passed extended payment plans. These plans have the following features: 
	                    * Users can choose to repay in 3~4 installments. This is the most salient feature of the plans. And they can repay with zero additional charges. There is a minimum repayment term typically between 60~90 days. The plans may be limited to use to once a year. Consumers may only be eligible if they read a threshold of rollovers. The lends may be required to disclose the availability of the extended payment plans.

                        The main data I use for the study is Clarity payday loan data. Clarity is a subsidiary of Experian. The Clarity data is the largest payday loan in the market, which covers 60 million or 70% of non-prime consumers in the US. The sample data I use covers 2015 Jan 1 to 2020 Dec 31. It includes borrower's characteristics, age, net monthly income, pay frequency, housing status, months at address, which I will us as independent variables. The outcome varibles will be financial health related variables. In my study, I have constrcuted 4 indicators: amount past due, original charge-off, delinquency rate, charge-off or debt-in-collections rate. The final data is aggregated at quarterly level for each state. In the end, there are 14 control and 5 treated states.

                        Another important data source is each state's deferred deposit transaction law. That's where I found the exact treated dates for extended payment plans in each state. Then I can construct treatment variables with these dates. The table here lists the five treated states. The 2 important columns are "state treated" and "quarter being treated". We can see that some states are treated a bit earlier, so later. 
                        (In total, there are 24 quarters since there are 6 years. The rest of 10 treated states are excluded since the sample data I have do not have pre-treatment data.)

                        * To identify treatment effects of the extended payment plans, I use synthetic DiD model. At first glance, it looks very similar to DiD model but with two extra terms in the end. 
                        * Let me quickly go through some key notations first in this equation: 
	                    * \( Y_{it} \) is the financial health in state i, quarter t
	                    * \( \mu \) is intercept.
	                    * \( \alpha_{i} \), \(\beta_{t} \) are state, quarter fixed effects
	                    * \( \tau \) is our interest ATT or average treatment effet on the treated
	                    * \( D_{it} \) is treatment variable, D = 1 if passed extended payment plans, 0 otherwise
	                    * \( w_{i} \) and $\lambda_{t}$ are unit and time weights, which I will introduce more in a bit.

                        Because SDID requires a clear definition of the pre-treatment period and control units, we have to run SDID for each treated state, so we get 5 ATTs, then we get the final ATT by weighting each ATT by the ratio of a state's treated vs total treated periods. For example, the sum of treated periods for the 5 states is 65, so that's the denominator. Deleware was treated for 8 states, so we reweight ATT of Deleware by $\frac{8}{65}$. Do the same for the rest of treated states and sum them up.

                        * To summarize what we have learned: 
                        * Payday loan borrowers prone to "debt traps" because of its high APRs and rollovers. I use the best existing coverage of Clarity payday loan data to uncover the effect of extended payment plans on financial health. I find that these plans indeed have positive effects on financial health. The policy implication is that, for those states where payday loan is legal, they may also implement similar plans to protect consumers. 
                        * One limitation of the study is that there are only 5 treated states in the sample data. In the future, we can conduct a more comprehensive study if there's more data coverage and we can include all 15 treated states.
                        * One interesting thing I observed is that, in Clarity payday loan data, we can actually observe both low & high income earners. And both income groups may experience negative income volatility. The brings me to the final chapter, which is an extension to Chapter 2.

                        The motivation behind this topic is because income volatility is still prevalent in the US. Income volatility has risen since the 1970s and it affects half the population in 2010. What's the most striking is that 37% of US HHs can't come up with $400 cash or its equivalent to cover emergency bills. A recent FDIC survey shows that 6 million (or 5%) HHs are "unbanked" and 19 million (or 14%) of them are "underbanked".

                        You may wonder: why not they just use traditional banks such as credit card to borrow money? Well, we just saw that 4.5% of US population are "unbanked", which means they don't have a bank account, so they don't have access to traditional credit. For those who do have bank accounts, they may fear jeopardizing their credit scores by borrowing from banks. So they resort to payday loan, which doesn't require checking credit scores. Given how "predatory" the payday loan is, some banks passed extended payment plans to protect these consumers.

                        This brings to my research question: ow do extended payment plans improve financial health of borrowers facing varying income volatility? As mentioned earlier, this is an extension to the second Chapter. My contribution is that the income volatility data uses intra-year data since it's at quarterly level, instead of typical annual data. And it has a more extensive data coverage since it covers more than 70% of non-prime consumers, and the income earners can be both low and higher earners. The policy implication is that the findings from this research may shed light to financial health related policies such as building better indicators to understand American HHs financial well-being.

                        I'll also skip information about Clarity data and the extended payment plans legal status. What I'd like to add is the definition of income volatility. There are many ways to quantify income volatility. In my research, I decided to use income coefficient of variation or here I call it income CV, which is used in various papers, such as Hannagan and Morduch (2015), which uses the US Financial Diaries data. We get income CV by diviging the standard deviation of income with mean of income and multiply by 100%. So income CV will always be positive, which means we focus on the magnitude of the changes in income, not the change of direction. And the larger the values are, the more volatile the income. The final data is aggregated at yearly level for each borrower for each year. So there will be 6 separate sample data (2015~2020). In 2015, there're about 1500 borrowers in treated states & 4 thousand in control states. The rest of year the borrowers may increase or decrease a bit.

                        Since double machine learning uses both econometrics & machine learning techniques, we'll introduce some machine learning methods to avoid overfitting. If the model overfits, it'll give us very poor estimates in the end. Here we'll use 5-fold cross validation, a pretty common setting. I use random forest model for its model efficiency and great prediction performance. For each fold, the maximum depth is set at 5 and minimum sample leaf at 2. [may put these details in extra slidese in the end] Then we average the 5-fold estimators to get a final ATE.

                        I'll take "amount past due" as an example here. All results shown here are negative and significant except for 2015. There's no clear pattern of increasing or decreasing. Of course, for 2020 results, we need to take special considerations since most of the year was in covid shocks.
                        * From 2019-2020: there is 43.48% reduction in number of borrowers. The reasons are: 
                        * (a) fewer payday loans were approved due to the pandemic when people were losing jobs and experiencing declined incomes.
                        * (b) federal and local governments implemented stimulus policies and debt relief measures that reduced the need for alternative financial services loans.
                        * (c) consumers spent less during the pandemic.
                        For these reasons, I only 2020 results just for reference. We can see the effect is quite large here. But we can't really take that as they are due to covid shocks.

                        To get CATE, I use the best-linear-predictor of the linear score following Semenova and Chernozhukov (2021).

                        Here's the visualized results for CATE for variable amount past due in each year. The overall trend in each year appears to be U-shaped: people who are in between the first quartile and median income volatility benefit the most from this law; borrowers at the first 25th percentile gradually receive more and more treatment effect; people between median and third quartile receive less and less treatment effect until the effect disappears; after the third quartile, people do not seem to receive any treatment effect overall. Second, people whose income volatility is below 75% percentile generally do receive a reduction in their amount past due because of extended payment plans. Finally, the treatment effect varies from year to year, and there seems to be no apparent pattern (i.e., if the treatment effect increases or decreases over the years).

                        I'll just add some comments on top of the results I just presented: The income CV used in this chapter is invariant to scales or absolute changes in income. So it won't show income dynamics over time, for example, whether the income volatility moves toward a positive direction or negative direction. The future work could introduce other types of income volatility measures that measure how frequent the income changes are and the directions of the changes.
